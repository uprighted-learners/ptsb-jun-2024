# What to do when you get stuck

Firstly, spend at least some time trying to solve the problem yourself.

Some strategies you can try include:

-   reread the assignment description, check for any advice or specific recommendations
-   rewatch the relevant portion of the class video to see if you missed something
-   check your code line-by-line for errors such as mismatched brackets, etc
-   if you have an error, try googling the error message
    -   look for results on Stack Overflow (make sure the answer you're looking at is well-rated)

When something in your code that previously worked stops working:

-   check whether stashing your changes or reverting to a previous commit fixes it
    -   if yes, try reapplying your stashed changes line-by-line
-   comment out as much code as you can, and then put it back in section by section
-   add lots of console logs!
-   try using the debugger in the devtools

### When it's time to ask for help, take the time to write a good question

A good question includes:

-   what is your goal, what task are you trying to accomplish
-   what have you tried, and what did you expect
-   what unexpected thing happened instead
    -   copy and paste any error messages you encountered
    -   if it's a terminal error, include the command that generated the error
-   what resources did you consult
    -   link to any relevant documentation
    -   link to, or quote from, any class notes or videos you referred to
